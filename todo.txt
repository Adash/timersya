  together with the time, date, user etc to the firebase on save

  Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an 
  unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory 
  leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and 
  asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.
