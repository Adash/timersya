# small tasks

- merge ButtonLink and Button styles used on Home Screen

- add redirect to paths which should be protected when not logged in

- split home component in two components (unauthenticated and authenticated)

- fix the bux when the sign up (and maybe log in) 
form is moving up when the error message appears

- add option for editing date

- add option for editing time

- add medium queries to add different display format to the desktop view

- implement the app as Progressive Web App

- TimesHistory - come up with better filtering solution

## Medium tasks

- extract the Firebase data fetching logic used in TimesHistory into a hook
  which could be also used in stats

- adjust positioning on login and signup screens

- fix the size 'flicker' when switching from time fo options 

?? error when edit description: 
  Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an 
  unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory 
  leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and 
  asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.
